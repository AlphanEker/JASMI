Health Tracker

Project Description
Health Tracker is a patient management system for medical institutions and patients, in which patients are able to  keep track of their medical procedures such as accessing their medical records, detailed hospital informations or available medicines at a selected pharmacy or drug store. Therefore thy system will be available to patients, pharmacists and doctors, with different functions for every user type.

Current Status
Our program currently works and displays some of the main functions of our application. However, since we couldn’t access to databases that store’s the required medical informations, we’ve manually added some medical data to our code. Those data will be used in our functions automatically and will be displayed in our GUI.

Our code contains classes that implement different account types and their relevant functions. Also, our related GUI pages are contained under the package pages. We also used JRE Java System Library. For coding classes, we’ve mostly used VS Code (version 1.55). For GUI design, we’ve used Eclipse IDE 2021-23 and its Window Builder add-on.

INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To start our program, first run LogInPage.java under the package Pages.
Then, Log in page will be displayed to user.

To Log in as a PATIENT account and use patient main page:
	USERNAME = patient
	PASSWORD = 12345

To Log in as a HOSPITAL account and use patient main page:
	USERNAME = hospital
	PASSWORD = 12345

To Log in as a Pharmacy account and use patient main page:
	USERNAME = pharmacy
	PASSWORD = 12345

You can exit the frame with default close operation. Then, you can run LogIn.java again to log in with a different account.

All three different account types have their unique menus and functions.
